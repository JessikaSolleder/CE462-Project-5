Probabilistic Analysis of Planar Slope Failure

The factor of safety for a planar slope failure can be expressed as:

where: 𝑐 is the cohesion, 𝐿𝑠 is the length of the failure plane, 𝑊m is the weight of the
sliding mass, 𝛼𝑠 is the inclination of the failure plane, and 𝜙 is the angle of internal
friction. The geometry of the slope and associated failure plane are shown in Figure 1
below.

This program wll determine the probability of failure for a slope with a planar failure surface.
The figure below shows the average (most likely) values for the soil properties and slope geometry.

This project will do the following:
- Compute the length of the failure plane (Ls)
- Compute the weight of the sliding mass (Wm)
- Compute the factor of safety for the average values
- Compute the probability of failure for 10 simulations using a normal distribution. Plot the histogram for the factor of safety values.
- distribution. 
- Compute the probability of failure for 100 simulations using a normal distribution. Plot the histogram for the factor of safety values.
- Compute the probability of failure for 1000 simulations using a normal distribution. Plot the histogram for the factor of safety values.

Project Deliverables:
In a memo, detail your calculations (length of the failure plane and weight of the sliding
mass) and standard deviation for soil properties. Then, present the factor of safety for
the average values, the three factor safety histograms and their associated probability
of failure for the slope. How many simulations do you feel are necessary to obtain a
reliable value of the probability of failure?

Assumptions:
- Standard deviation for cohesion (c): 30% (COV)
- Standard deviation for angle of internal friction (𝜙): 13% (COV)
- Standard deviation for unit weight (𝛾): 5% (COV)
